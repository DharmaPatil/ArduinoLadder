<h2>ArduinoLadder by 01kos</h2>

<p>Do you want to program your Arduino as if it were a PLC?.</p>
<p>Or you simply want to learn ladder logic and see it running in the physical world but do not have the cash to buy an actual PLC?</p>
<p>Then, here is a solution for you. The free, open source, all you can eat, solution to do just that (and more).</p>
<p>ArduinoLadder is a multiplatform GUI application that allows you to create ladder logic programs to be compiled and downloaded to your Arduino. Based on the <a href="http://www.electronics-micros.com/software-hardware/plclib-arduino/">plcLib code by Electronics & Micros</a>, this app makes your I/O logic as easy as flipping a switch.</p>
<p>We are working on binaries and installers, for now feel free to get the code and compile it in Mono (with Xamarin or Visual Studio). You need to install the Arduino IDE to run it.</p>
